    particle_number.jl

Functions for handling particle number preservation in Pauli operators.

In quantum computing with fermionic systems encoded in qubits, the particle number
operator counts the total number of particles (occupied states). For a system of N qubits,
the particle number operator is:

    N̂ = Σᵢ (I - Zᵢ)/2

where the sum runs over all qubits. This counts how many qubits are in the |1⟩ state.

A Pauli operator P preserves particle number if [N̂, P] = 0, i.e., if it commutes with
the particle number operator. For a single-qubit Pauli, this means:
- I and Z preserve particle number (they don't change occupancy)
- X and Y do not preserve particle number (they flip occupancy)

However, multi-qubit Paulis can preserve particle number even if they contain X or Y,
as long as the total number of occupancy changes sums to zero.

    particle_number_operator(N::Integer)

Create the particle number operator for N qubits.

The particle number operator is: N̂ = Σᵢ (I - Zᵢ)/2

This returns a `PauliSum` representing the number operator.

# Arguments
- `N::Integer`: Number of qubits

# Returns
- `PauliSum{N, ComplexF64}`: The particle number operator

# Example
```julia
N̂ = particle_number_operator(3)

    preserves_particle_number(p::PauliBasis{N}) where N

Check if a Pauli operator preserves particle number.

A Pauli operator preserves particle number if it commutes with the particle number operator
N̂ = Σᵢ (I - Zᵢ)/2. This requires [Zᵢ, P] = 0 for all i.

Since Zᵢ anti-commutes with Xᵢ and Yᵢ, P preserves particle number if and only if it contains
NO X or Y operators on any qubit - it must be composed only of I and Z operators.

# Arguments
- `p::PauliBasis{N}`: A Pauli operator

# Returns
- `Bool`: true if the operator preserves particle number (contains only I and Z)

# Example
```julia
p1 = PauliBasis(Pauli(4, Z=[1,2]))  # preserves: only Z
p2 = PauliBasis(Pauli(4, X=[1]))    # does NOT preserve: has X
p3 = PauliBasis(Pauli(4, X=[1,2]))  # does NOT preserve: has X

Filter a PauliSum to keep only terms that commute with a given particle number operator.

Use this when working in a transformed basis where the standard check may not apply.

"""
    filter_particle_number_preserving_pairs(ps::PauliSum{N,T}, N̂::PauliSum{N}) where {N,T}

Filter a PauliSum using a pair-based approach for particle number preservation.

This function identifies pairs of Pauli operators in the input PauliSum that together
preserve particle number. A pair is kept if the sum of the two operators commutes with
the particle number operator. This searches all pairwise combinations to find pairs
that preserve particle number when combined.

This is useful for fermionic systems where individual terms may not preserve particle number
but pairs (e.g., from fermionic hopping terms c†ᵢcⱼ + c†ⱼcᵢ) do.
